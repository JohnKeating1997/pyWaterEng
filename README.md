# PyWaterEng
This repo is for undergraduate water engineering education, including hydrology and hydraulics. With the help of this package, you can check your homework calculation (some are extremely error-prone) and visualize your results.

For hydrology, we cover:

* Infiltration (Horton method)
* Runoff (unit hydrograph, linear reservoir model)
* Frequency analysis
* Rational method

For hydraulics, we cover:

* Hydrostatics
* Bernoulli equation
* Manning equation (Pipe flow and open channel flow)
* Orifice
* Reynolds number
